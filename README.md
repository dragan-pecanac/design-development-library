# Unity Game Design & Development Resources  
The amount of resources available for free are astounding. However, with so many paths to take, tutorials to follow, and books to read it may be intimidating. This "guide" covers the absolute basics of game dev concepts.

## Game Development
### Design
Design is the *pre-production* stage of the game development process. No matter how simple the game in mind may be, it is vital to have the general concept mapped out for various reasons. As a beginner, the first thing you should figure out is whether a specific concept, or the entire game, is too complex for you to handle. While getting out of your comfort zone should be the goal, overdoing it may lead to valuable time wasted and losing motivation.

#### Concept
This is the brainstorming stage. The bulk of it consists of various questions, and hopefully answers to these questions. Some examples:
- will the game be in **2D** or **3D**?
- what **genre** of game will it be?<br>
(sport, racing, puzzle, FPS, platformer, visual novel, turn-based, tower defense, simulation, RPG)
- what is the **art style**?<br>
(pixel, hand-drawn, geometric)
- what **gameplay mechanics** do you want implemented?<br>
(scoring, levels, leaderboards)
- what platform are you building it for?<br>
(mobile-android, mobile-iOS, PC)

While answering these questions, you should create a "rough draft" library of things to include in the game (characters, enemies, textures, objects). At this point, the game's objective should be clear and concept art (no matter the quality) should be established. The storyline rough draft is complete with plot points and story arcs.

#### Storyboarding
Storyboarding is the process of creating cards to represent scenes. These cards can visually represent characters, plot points, tone, and actions. Note, the scenes created here should match the layout of the finished product. Use this to help determine if the game would look better in a horizontal vs. vertical layout.

#### R&D
The research and development (R&D) part of design will vary depending on the scope of the project. This is where you determine what software/engine/tools will be needed to create the product, whether or not you need to utilize outside resources, and who the target audience is. 
- Is the software available for free? What are the conditions?<br>
(Unity is available for free via Personal license. Conditions: you don't earn or receive more than $100,000 in revenue or funding in the last 12-month period.)
- Will you need to hire outside resources, such as freelancers, or utilize outsourcing services?<br>
(developers, designers, artists)
- Are you creating an educational game?<br>
(contributing to an open source program focusing on teaching kids would be a better audience than simply sharing your project on itch.io)

#### Game Design Document
Although your project may not need an extensive Game Design Document (GDD), such as one needed for a AAA title, it is still extremely useful to take note on everything you're planning on adding to the game. All the things you have thought of in the [Concept](#concept) section should be recorded in this document. Even if the document sounds silly for a small project, it can help you create a great one for the next bigger project.<br>

#### Prototyping
A basic prototype will allow you to see what concepts work and which do not. Have several people test it and take note of their feedback.
